# Nutri
Nutri is a web application that was built for personal use. It's an app that facilitates the work of counting food nutrient information. It has a simple home page where it shows all meals we introduce in the app, a section where we can add our meals by specifying which food and in what amount we are making the meal. And one final page is analytics, in this section, the user selects a day, and the app return all information about that day if there's something to show, otherwise it won't show anything.
